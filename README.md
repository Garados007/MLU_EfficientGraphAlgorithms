# MLU: Efficient Graph Algorithms

My own code (home work) of the master lecture efficient graph algorithms summer
2024. I won't maintain the code after that period and will archive this project.

## License

Out of personal interests I have to change the license at the certain date.

### Before 2024-10-01

No license. You aren't allowed to use this in your projects. You are allowed to
look at the code and get some ideas but copying any code is prohibited.

### After 2024-10-01

You are allowed to use GNU GPLv3 with one restriction:

> If you are a student at any school or university you aren't allowed to submit
> this code as your solution. But you are still allowed to get some ideas how to
> do things and copy some functions (how much depends on the rules in your class
> or university).

## Why is this project open source?

For a single reason: CI. I want to use the Github CI infrastructure to test and
build my code. Although my university provides a selfhosted Gitlab instance
there is no CI there which I can use.

The project has to be public to be enabled to use the free public runners.
